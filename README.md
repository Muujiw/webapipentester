# Web API Pentester Tool

This cybersecurity tool is designed for penetration testing on web APIs. It helps automate the process of checking different username and password combinations, leveraging proxy rotation to evade rate limiting.

## Features:

- Supports multiple proxy modes (HTTP, SOCKS5, or no proxy).
- Efficient and concurrent testing using multithreading.
- Automatically handles different API responses, such as rate limiting or successful logins.
- Saves valid credentials to a file for easy access.
- Clear display of testing progress and statistics.

## Installation:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Muujiw/webapipentester.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project folder:**
    ```bash
    cd webapipentester
    ```

3. **Install the required Python packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install requests
    ```

## Usage:

1. Populate the `proxies.txt` file with a list of proxies if you intend to use them.
2. Populate the `wordlist.txt` file with a list of credentials in the format: `username:password`.
3. **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    python WEB_API_PENTESTER.py
    ```

4. **Follow the on-screen prompts:**
    - Choose the proxy mode (HTTP, SOCKS5, or no proxy).
    - Specify the number of threads you'd like to utilize.

## Output:

- The program will display valid credentials in yellow and indicate credentials with no subscription.
- Invalid credentials will be shown in red.
- Valid credentials will also be saved to `successlist.txt`.

## Important Note:

Make sure to have permission to perform penetration testing on the target API. Unauthorized testing is illegal and unethical.
